## Team Roles

- **Backend Developer:** Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.
- **Database Administrator:** Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.
- **DevOps Engineer:** Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.

## Database Design

- **Users**(name,id,email,password)
- **properties**(type, address, id, owner_id,room_nr)
- **booking**(id, start_date_price)
- **reviews**(property_id,rating, date)
